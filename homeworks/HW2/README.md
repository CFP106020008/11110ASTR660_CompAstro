Both of your result should looks like this.
### Exercise 3

If you calculate those errors by brute force, it should looks like this. 
### Exercise 4 (omit)

All curves should follow the same slope of $N^{-1.5}$. But why?
This is because $\sqrt{1-x^2}$ is NOT a well-behaved function since $f'\rightarrow \infty$ as $x\rightarrow 1$ or $x\rightarrow -1$.

So if we instead use a well-behaved function, such as $\sqrt{2-x^2}$. You will get a good result.
