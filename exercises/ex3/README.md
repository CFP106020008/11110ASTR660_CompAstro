Please pay attention to the following points:

1. You should use ***formatted output*** when using ```write``` funtion. If you don't use it you will not get the bouns point. (See last page of Lecture 3 or [Fortran Formats](https://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs201/NOTES/chap05/format.html)) 
2. The output figure shoule be the ***log-log*** plot.

P.S. It is better to use double precision to avoid roundoff error.
