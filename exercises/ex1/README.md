# Exercise 1
In this exercise you are asked to write a simple code that use **numpy** and **for loop** to calculate the sum between two integers $a_{\rm min}$ to $a_{\rm max}$.

The solution is simple. In numpy, there is an ```arange``` function that can generate an array of integer. Then, you just need to loop through the array and sum them up.

Here I introduced the ```argv``` function that can directly take the arguments from the command line. Therefore you do not have to edit the script when you want to change $a_{\rm min}$ to $a_{\rm max}$.

I also encourage you to have a look at [pylint](https://codertw.com/%E7%A8%8B%E5%BC%8F%E8%AA%9E%E8%A8%80/358201/), which is a python package that can help you check and optimize the style of your code.
