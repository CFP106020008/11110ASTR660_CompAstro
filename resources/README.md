## .bashrc
Put it in your home directory.
Then each time you open a terminal, it will automatically run through this file and execute the command in it so that you don't have to setup the environment all over again every time.

## .vimrc
Similar to ```.bashrc```, but for vim.
Note that I added a line ```colorscheme molokai```, which only works if you have installed the molokai color scheme.
You can download the color scheme from [here](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai).
